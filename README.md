# travo-greenfield

**Travel-router web UI and API for OpenWrt (GL.iNet Slate AX, Beryl AX).** Join hotel WiFi, handle captive portals, see if you are online, switch VPN on and off, with DNS filtering by AdGuard Home. Runs on the router next to LuCI.

Status: design phase, no code yet. Target 0.1.0.

## Install

On the router, as root (OpenWrt 25.12 or newer, aarch64). Download `travo-greenfield-<version>-aarch64.tar.gz` and `checksums.txt.sig` from the GitHub release and copy both over. Extract, put the `.sig` next to the extracted files, then run the installer; it verifies the signature with the router's `usign` before it touches anything:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/tg && tar -xzf travo-greenfield-<version>-aarch64.tar.gz -C /tmp/tg
cp checksums.txt.sig /tmp/tg/
sh /tmp/tg/install.sh
```

Start with a fresh OpenWrt installation. The first install trusts the release key inside the tarball and stores it in `/etc/travo-greenfield/minisign.pub`; later installs must match that key, or pass `--rotate-key` once when the release notes announce a new one. Builds you made yourself are unsigned: install them with `--insecure`.

The UI answers on `http://<router>/` by default, and LuCI moves to ports 8080 and 8443. To leave LuCI in place, pass `--port N` during install and open `http://<router>:N`. Remove it with `sh /tmp/tg/install.sh --uninstall`; add `--purge` to also delete its config and state. Settings live in `/etc/config/travo-greenfield`. Build the tarball yourself with `mise run package`.

The dashboard shows the active uplink, carrier, and internet reachability separately. It also shows one-minute CPU load, memory use, uptime, and the running version. Use **Refresh** to update the resource summary. The interface throughput table updates every two seconds.

Use **System → Download backup** to save the router configuration as `travo-config.tar.gz`.

System can check GitHub for a newer stable release. An automatic attempt occurs only when opening System, at most once per 24 hours. Use **Check for updates** to check manually. Set `travo-greenfield.main.release_source` to an alternate GitHub `OWNER/REPO` or `off`, then restart the daemon. The default is `blackdark-org/travo-greenfield`.

When System finds a newer release, **Verify package** checks the signed archive and stages it for up to 30 minutes. Verification leaves the installed version running.
