# travo-greenfield

Travel-router web UI and API (Go daemon + Svelte SPA) that runs on OpenWrt next to LuCI. Clean-room rewrite of Travo.

## Verify

`mise run check` green before every commit (not set up yet: first roadmap slice). Hardware-only behaviour is gated by the playbook in `docs/testing.md`.

## Stack

Follows https://github.com/BlackDark/agent-presets/blob/main/stack/core.md and `stack/embedded-ui.md`.
Deviations:
- Backend Go with Huma-generated OpenAPI + hey-api client: no hand-written spec (docs/adr/0003).
- Paraglide with `en` only (docs/adr/0004).
- No Zod in the daemon path; Zod Mini/Valibot only for UI boundaries not covered by the generated client.
- Distribution is a release tarball + install script, not a package (docs/adr/0007).

## Map

- `docs/spec.md` product scope for 0.1.0; `docs/roadmap.md` order and later features.
- `docs/invariants.md` MUST rules; read before touching live state, auth, DNS, WiFi. Breaking one needs an ADR.
- `docs/device-facts.md` hardware lessons; `docs/testing.md` test layers and fixture rules.
- `docs/adr/` decisions; `docs/glossary.md` terms.

## Every change

Same PR, only what the change touches:
- tests for the changed behaviour; fixtures are verbatim device payloads with provenance, never invented fields
- docs that describe it (spec, invariants, ADR when a decision changes)
- README when a user-visible feature changes
- screenshots after visual changes

## Code style

- Data in, data out: pure functions, side effects (I/O, time, randomness) at the edges and passed in.
- Expected failures are values (`error` in Go, `Result`/unions in TS); panic/throw for bugs only.
- Composition over inheritance.
- Small units: split a file past ~400 lines, a function past ~60.
- Names explain what, comments explain why.
- Refactors keep behaviour and land in their own commit.
- All OpenWrt access goes through the `Device` / `PackageManager` ports; all live-state changes through the transaction module; all DNS changes through the layer stack.

## Stewardship

Leave every touched area cleaner than found.
- Small fixes beside the change (dead code, stale doc, missing test, unclear name): own commit, same PR.
- Whatever the change makes obsolete goes in the same PR.
- Larger problems: report with `file:line` and a proposal; the PR stays on topic.

## Git

- Conventional Commits. One topic per PR.
- Merge: rebase when commits are logically separate, squash otherwise.
- PR already merged → branch anew from `origin/main`, open a new PR.
- `--force-with-lease` on own branches only.

## Boundaries

- `sudo`, system packages, global installs: the user runs them; ask with what and why.
- No `.github/FUNDING.yml` yet: ask, then copy https://github.com/BlackDark/agent-presets/blob/main/templates/FUNDING.yml
- Running user processes stay up; test on other ports.
- Never run destructive probes against a real device; GET-only first.
- Language: code, comments, docs, commits in English; UI English via Paraglide.

## Gotchas

- Never call `wifi`, `wifi up/down/reload` in an apply path (ath11k crash).
- Netifd route state lies; read the kernel table.
- Fixtures that invent fields caused the worst shipped bugs.
