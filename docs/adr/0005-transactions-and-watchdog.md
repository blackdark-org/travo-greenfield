# 0005 Self-owned transactions with an out-of-process watchdog

Status: accepted (watchdog behaviour to be proven by spike S4)

rpcd `uci apply` rollback snapshots at apply time and needs a session id and stored root login ([device-facts §4](../device-facts.md)). Travo does not use it.

Flow: guard → snapshot affected `/etc/config/*` to `/tmp` → one commit/apply → a tiny procd-run script restores the snapshot (`uci reload_config` + `network reload`, never `wifi`) unless a confirm file appears within N seconds → per-interface carrier and kernel-route probes → only the user's confirm writes the file. A daemon crash or kill cannot strand the router because the watchdog is a separate process. Guard is removed only after full success.

Consequence: the UI promise is that a bad change reverts itself; "rolled back" is shown only when true.

Implementation (`internal/txn`, `internal/uciwrite`):
- One transaction pending at a time (guard `txn-in-progress`). Locks per config name, taken in sorted order, not reentrant (the stage callback gets a ctx that marks them held).
- Order: guard, refuse foreign staged changes, snapshot `/etc/config/<cfg>` (absent = delete on restore) to flash, stage, refuse "no changes", start the detached watchdog (own session) and record its pid, commit (re-checking stop and claim before each), `reload_config`, probe, then write `armed`. Probe/commit/reload failure restores at once through the same script.
- `Begin` starts one `ApplyBudget` deadline immediately before starting the watchdog. Commits, reload and probe share that deadline and the caller's cancellation. The CLI runner uses `exec.CommandContext`. The budget relies on cancellation-aware adapters and cannot interrupt an uninterruptible OS operation. `ArmLimit` exceeds the budget by a margin to allow canceled commands to exit before watchdog fallback. On cancellation or expiry, immediate rollback uses its own timeout. Begin checks the deadline and watchdog claim before arming. The user's full confirmation window (min 15 s, from measured bring-up) starts at `armed`. If `armed` never appears within the arm limit, the watchdog restores.
- Confirm needs `armed`. Confirm and the watchdog race for one `claim` file (`O_EXCL` / noclobber): exactly one wins; a late confirm returns `closed`.
- States: pending, confirmed, rolled_back, restoring (claimed, no result yet: guard kept), rollback_failed (guard kept). "Rolled back" only when the script wrote `restored`. Finished restores are reaped on the next Get, Confirm or Begin, so a timeout restore does not block later changes; the guard is released only when no transaction is left on disk. Status calls may wait up to the settle time while a restore reports (accepted: mutations are serialised anyway).
- Snapshots live on flash, not `/tmp`: a reboot during the window must still restore. Startup `Recover` restores transactions whose watchdog is gone, cleans confirmed ones, keeps ones with a live watchdog, and discards ones that crashed before the watchdog started (nothing was committed).
- `Apply` is the direct path for configs that cannot strand the caller (dhcp for the DNS stack): locked, stage inside the lock, commit, reload, no watchdog. `wireless`, `network`, `firewall` are refused there.
- Container-proven (25.12.6, 24.10.8): the watchdog restores after the daemon process dies, survives a procd `service stop` (booted container, procd as PID 1), and confirm keeps the change. Hardware-only: whether `reload_config` alone brings WiFi back, and the measured window (playbook in docs/testing.md).
