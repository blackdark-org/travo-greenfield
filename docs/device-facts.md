# Device facts

Hard-won findings. Do not re-learn. Origin: the previous Travo implementation. Re-capture and re-date them in this repo as fixtures (see [testing.md](testing.md)). `[HW]` = observed on hardware, `[TRIED]` = approach that failed, `[BUG]` = past defect to keep as a regression check.

Reference hardware: GL-AXT1800 (IPQ6018, ath11k, radio0 = 5 GHz usually uplink STA, radio1 = AP), OpenWrt 25.12.3 (also 25.12.6), netifd 2026.02.26. Also targeted: GL-MT3000. dnsmasq config is a NAMED section (e.g. `dhcp.cfg01411c`), not `@dnsmasq[0]`. `rg` is absent on device. BusyBox `sed`/`wget`/`tar` differ from GNU. `jsonfilter` is present. `scp` needs `-O`.

Greenfield captures and spike results (2026-11-09, AXT1800 25.12.6): `testdata/device/axt1800-25.12.6/SPIKES.md`.

## 0. UCI reads

- [HW] `uci show` prints a one-element LIST exactly like an option (`dhcp.cfg01411c.server='127.0.0.1#5353'`). dnsmasq's init script reads `server` only as a list (`config_list_foreach`), so writing it back as `option server` silently drops it: no `server=` line, `noresolv=1`, every query REFUSED, config "looks" unchanged. Read with `uci export` (keeps `list`/`option`) or `ubus call uci get` (JSON array).
- [HW] `reload_config` hands changes to procd triggers asynchronously: wireless live ~1.4 s, dnsmasq ~2–4 s after commit. Probes must wait, not read once.

## 1. Routes and netifd

- [HW] After WireGuard disable: `network.interface.wwan` status shows a DHCP default route, `ip -4 route show table main` has none, `wget` exits 4. Netifd state ≠ kernel route. Every "route/internet ok" check reads the KERNEL table.
- [HW greenfield 2026-11-13] Reproduced: `wg0` `disabled=1` + `reload_config` removed `default dev wg0` and left NO default route although `wwan` status listed one (`wget` exit 4). `ifup wwan` restored the kernel default route (also left stale `/32` endpoint host routes via the uplink). Captures: `testdata/device/axt1800-25.12.6/wireguard/`.
- [HW greenfield] Changing only `wg0_peer0.endpoint_host` + `reload_config` kept the old endpoint live (`wg show wg0 endpoints`); `ifup wg0` applied it. A WireGuard peer edit needs an interface restart.
- [HW greenfield] Disabled `wg0`: `network.interface.wg0 status` → `Not found`, `wg show` empty. Enabled, no handshake: interface `up:true`, kernel `default dev wg0`, `wg show all dump` peer `latest-handshake` 0. Connected: same plus non-zero handshake epoch. `up:true` does not prove a working tunnel; only a recent handshake does.
- [HW] `wg show all dump` prints the interface PRIVATE key in column 2 of the interface line; parse `wg show <if> latest-handshakes` or redact.
- Disable recovery must not assume `wan` is the uplink; internet often arrives via WiFi STA. Recovery needs several bounded waits; some devices need script-level down/up, not only ubus.

## 2. Wireless liveness (ath11k / netifd)

- [HW] netifd emits `up`, `pending`, `retry_setup_failed`, `autostart` PER RADIO only. A per-interface entry is `{section, config, ifname, vlans, stations}`: no per-interface `up`, no config path.
- [HW] Per-interface truth: `network.device status {"name":"<ifname>"}` → `present`, `up`, `carrier`.
- [HW] Uplink STA with wrong password or nonexistent SSID: radio reads up, STA `carrier:false`. Only carrier proves association; must be REFUSED. Association + DHCP ≈ 10 s.
- [HW] Invalid STA channel is silently ignored (AP stays up); cannot simulate failure that way.
- [HW] AP with zero clients is genuinely up. `stations` is always empty for mode=sta; never use stations/assoclist for liveness.
- [HW] Bring-up: AP link ~10 s after radio start; STA ~4 s; wwan up ~10 s after DHCP.
- [HW] If one radio hosts two expected interfaces (guest + main AP), the radio flag proves only one. Check EACH interface; a radio flag alone is a false confirm that cancels rollback.
- Ubus round trips ~5 ms; budget ~100 ms per call. Unreadable payload (missing keys, unknown shape) ≠ down: report "cannot verify". Transport failure during a probe = unverifiable, retry; never claim "rolled back".
- [TRIED] Trusting per-interface `up` (absent on this firmware). [TRIED] A 4 s probe budget against a ~10 s bring-up. Derive budgets from measured latency.
- [HW greenfield] `uci commit wireless` + `reload_config` (no `wifi`) applied and restored an AP SSID change in ~1 s each; the STA on the other radio stayed associated. Wrong STA SSID: `carrier:false` and no kernel default route; after restore STA carrier in 7.8 s, default route 0.5 s later.
- [HW] `ubus call iwinfo scan '{"device":"phy0-sta0"}'` on the STA (associated or not) returns one entry per BSSID with `band` (2/5), `channel`, `mhz`, `signal` (dBm), `quality`/`quality_max`, `encryption.{enabled,wpa,authentication,ciphers}`; hidden networks have no `ssid` key. No crash with an AP up on the other radio (testdata `wwan-down/`).
- [HW greenfield 2026-11-13] With no STA interface, `ubus call iwinfo scan '{"device":"phy0"}'` (or `radio0`) scans that radio read-only: rc 0, ~4.7 s, AP on the other radio stayed `up`/`carrier`, `iw dev` and `uci changes` unchanged. A scan covers only its radio's band; a dual-band list needs one scan per radio (`phy1`/the AP ifname scans 2.4 GHz in ~2 s without dropping the AP). Captures: `testdata/device/axt1800-25.12.6/wifi-scan/`.
- [HW greenfield] `iwinfo scan` can exceed `TierRead` (about 4.7 s on 5 GHz), so scan replies use `TierScan`.
- [HW] Only enabled APs have a `hostapd.<ifname>` ubus object. `iwinfo assoclist` was empty while `hostapd.*` `get_clients` listed the station: use `get_clients`.

## 3. ath11k crash triggers

- [HW] AP + STA on the same radio, committed even transiently → driver crash. The AP channel follows the STA channel; an upstream drop takes the local AP down.
- `wifi reload` is a crash risk on ath11k/IPQ6018. `wifi down/up` from timers or hotplug has no rollback → forbidden except bounded documented recovery.
- Required order: stage everything, reconcile layout, single commit, single apply.

## 4. Rollback

- [HW, AXT1800 25.12.3] rpcd `uci apply` with `rollback:true` snapshots at APPLY time. If the change was already committed, rollback restores the CHANGED config (30 s expired → broken profile still enabled, working uplink disabled). `uci revert` after commit is a no-op.
- Requirement: snapshot BEFORE the commit; restore explicitly; reload via `uci reload_config` + `network reload`. Never `wifi`.
- rpcd `uci apply/confirm` REQUIRE an rpcd session id that bare ubus CLI cannot supply; login needs the real root password (anonymous login works only with NO root password). Travo does not use them (ADR-0005).

## 5. Caller classification (lockout)

- [HW] `network.interface dump` gives IPv4 as `{"address":"192.168.1.1","mask":24}`, NOT a CIDR string. A parser expecting a CIDR key made every client "unknown" while tests stayed green (the fixture invented the key).
- [HW] `br-lan` carries wired AND WiFi clients in one /24; subnet match cannot separate them. Use the neighbour table (ARP) → MAC → AP station dumps.
- Incident: an operator switched to Client mode from a phone on the AP; the AP vanished; recovery needed a wired console. Nothing asserted the rule.

## 6. Band switching

- [HW] STA band switch = change STA radio + apply/confirm = 2–5 s connectivity gap. Guard it. Scanning while STA is up works.

## 7. Captive portal and DNS

- [HW] A status probe with no default route took 3 s (DNS timeout). Skip the probe when there is no route.
- `noresolv=1` with custom forwarders blocks hotel DNS. Encrypted upstreams (DoH/DoT) cannot resolve hotel names. Rebind protection drops RFC1918 answers → must be off during bypass.
- The portal's first fetch may need a DHCP renew on wwan (MAC change / stale lease): conditional and guarded.
- [TRIED] Restore-on-reconnect inside a GET handler: every poll rewrote dnsmasq and restarted it. GET must never mutate.

## 8. Scheduled and button WiFi toggle (post-0.1)

- Cron is `/etc/crontabs/root`; `/etc/cron.d` does NOT exist (write → ENOENT; the UI then shows a schedule that never fires).
- Buttons: detect from devicetree `/sys/firmware/devicetree/base/keys/*/label`; `/etc/rc.button` is generic stock scripts, not a source of truth. Hotplug button scripts run as root via procd.
- The old toggle helper needed a stored rpcd login file; missing → every scheduled/button toggle silently no-opped. It also did uci set/commit/apply/confirm OUTSIDE in-process locks and could clobber the API's staged delta. In travo-greenfield helpers call the daemon instead.
- [BUG] Auto-reconnect cron ran `wifi up` every minute with no uplink → radios flapping. Cap and guard.
- [BUG] Radio switch via notification broke WiFi. Keep as a regression check.
- [BUG] After an OpenWrt upgrade Travo did not start (see §10).

## 9. mwan3 (post-0.1)

- [HW] Installing mwan3 with no working WAN → stock catch-all rules route 0/0 into an unhealthy policy → every policy `unreachable`, all outbound "Network unreachable" while lease and WiFi look fine. Recovery: remove the catch-all rules. Verify with a real outbound request, not uplink status.
- [HW] `uci apply mwan3` via rpcd → `Permission denied` until `luci-app-mwan3` is installed (its rpcd ACL). The package alone is not enough. A stuck failover guard can mean "missing ACL".
- The router may be unable to download `luci-app-mwan3` over its own uplink → side-load (`scp -O`, `apk add --allow-untrusted`).
- [TRIED, DATA LOSS] Ownership-by-content deleted stock `config interface 'wan'` (identical bytes to the generated default). Never delete by content match.
- Failback: evaluating "keep current active" first made failback unreachable. Priority walk first.

## 10. Sysupgrade and upgrades

- [HW] The keep-list must include `/etc/rc.d/S99travo` (boot link) as well as the init script, binary and UCI enable. A missing link after 25.12.3 → 25.12.6 left the service inactive, no API.
- After an upgrade the old binary may keep running: verify the running exe path; restart, not start.
- Package manager: 25.x = apk, older = opkg; detect at runtime. Package lists live in `/tmp` and vanish on reboot.
- Travo's own firmware upload drops installed packages; LuCI attended sysupgrade keeps them. Travo reports updates, LuCI flashes.

## 11. AdGuard Home

- [HW] Reinstall over a config written by a newer AdGuard: v0.107.54 crash-loops on `unknown current schema version 33`. dnsmasq kept forwarding to `127.0.0.1#5353` → ALL LAN DNS dead, uplink fine, Travo reported healthy. Cached answers hide it for minutes; test with a fresh name.
- [HW] The init script read `/opt/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml`; editing the path named in UCI `config_file` did nothing (relevant to the manual-binary install; the package route in ADR-0006 must be re-verified).
- Open decision: refuse a downgrade on reinstall instead of silent breakage.
- Old design exposed the first-run wizard LAN-wide and setting a password ADDED an admin instead of replacing one. Never reproduce: loopback bind, no accounts, Travo-gated proxy.
- [HW greenfield] Package `adguardhome` 0.107.79-r1 (25.12.6 feed): config `/etc/adguardhome/adguardhome.yaml`, work dir `/var/lib/adguardhome`, runs in ujail; yaml and `/etc/config/adguardhome` are apk conffiles and in `/lib/upgrade/keep.d/`.
- [HW greenfield] As old Travo left it: `0.0.0.0:3000`, `users: []` → full admin API (GET and POST) open to the LAN without auth. A root-path reverse proxy on its own port serves UI and API unchanged; AGH#7985 did not reproduce on 0.107.79.
- [HW greenfield] AGH stopped → LAN DNS REFUSED; a layer to the uplink resolver restored resolution in 0.13 s.
- Reported by others, unverified here: AGH on :53 leaves the router unable to resolve for itself; Tailscale MagicDNS overwrites `resolv.conf` (tailscale#15174, luci#8641).

## 12. USB tethering (0.2)

- Android: RNDIS on `usb0` or CDC-NCM on `usb0` (different kernel drivers); probe both. iOS needs `usbmuxd` + `libimobiledevice`, not plain RNDIS/NCM.
- Identify the uplink by MEDIUM, not by IP. It joins the `wan` zone → a direct firewall commit exception.

## 13. Clock and sessions

- No RTC: the router boots with a wrong clock. Sessions must not depend on wall clock. A far-future clock breaks TLS, cron, hwclock.

## 14. Logs, cron, flash, shell

- [HW] BusyBox crond logs every job start as `cron.err` at the default level; a per-minute job floods errors. Set level 9.
- NAND overlayfs: writes = wear + stall. `/tmp` is RAM; staged UCI and package lists are lost on reboot.
- [HW] BusyBox on 25.12.6 has no `timeout`, `diff`, `pkill`. Bound commands in Go, not in shell.
- [HW] BusyBox `wget` has no `-S`; with no default route it fails at once with `Operation not permitted`, exit 4. `ubus call dhcp ipv4leases` does not exist on 25.12.6 (`Method not found`): read `/tmp/dhcp.leases`.
- [HW] BusyBox `tr` has no character classes: `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` turned `OpenWrt` into `wenrt`. Use explicit ranges (`tr A-Z a-z`).
- BusyBox `sed` vs GNU `sed` escapes disagree: never escape JSON in sed; encode in code and write bytes verbatim. `wget -O` is required. Check signatures with `ubus -v list`; do not assume.
- `iw event` is a long-running listener: stop via signal, not a timeout tier. The uplink medium (ethernet/WiFi/USB) drives caller classification and failover candidates.
