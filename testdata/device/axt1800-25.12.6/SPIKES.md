# Spike results: GL-AXT1800, OpenWrt 25.12.6, 2026-11-09

Device: GL.iNet GL-AXT1800, OpenWrt 25.12.6 r33311-981c978eff (qualcommax/ipq60xx, ath11k), old Travo 0.10.2 installed.
Backup before any change: `~/travo-router-backups/20261109-171110-axt1800/` (sysupgrade backup, full overlay, RESTORE.md).
During live spikes, old Travo was stopped and its per-minute `wifi-reconnect.sh` cron paused; both restored afterwards. `/etc/config/{dhcp,wireless,network,firewall}` and the crontab were verified identical to the backup at the end.
Layout: radio0 = uplink STA `phy0-sta0` (wwan), radio1 = AP `phy1-ap0` (lan). Caller on Ethernet.

## S3 caller payloads: done
Captures in this directory (`PROVENANCE.md`, `with-ap-client/`). Parsers in `internal/device/facts`, end-to-end classification test in `internal/lockout/device_test.go`.
- `network.interface dump`: IPv4 as `{address, mask}`; `wan` (cable out) has no `l3_device`.
- `hostapd.<if> get_clients`: `{freq, clients: {<mac>: {assoc, authorized, ...}}}`; empty AP = `"clients": {}`.
- `ip -j -4 neigh`: `[{dst, dev, lladdr, state[]}]`. The phone on the AP and the Ethernet laptop are both on `br-lan`; only the hostapd MAC match separates them.
- Only one `hostapd.*` object exists (`hostapd.phy1-ap0`): disabled APs have none. `iwinfo assoclist` was empty while `get_clients` listed the station.

## S4 watchdog on hardware: done (logs `spikes/s4-*.log`)
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| AP SSID change via `uci commit` + `reload_config` (no `wifi`) | live in 1.4 s |
| Not confirmed: watchdog restore | 16.2 s after begin (15 s window); original SSID live 1.0 s later |
| STA during AP-only change | stayed associated, default route kept |
| Confirm | change kept past the window |
| Wrong uplink SSID | `network.device status`: `present:true, up:true, carrier:false`; kernel default route gone |
| Daemon death, wrong uplink | watchdog restored at 16.2 s; STA carrier back 7.8 s later; default route 0.5 s after that |
| Reboot during window | boot hook ran `Recover` at uptime 13 s: `rolled_back`; original SSID live right after boot |

Window: 15 s minimum stays. Restore plus uplink re-association took about 25 s end to end, so the UI must keep showing "restoring" that long.

## S5 DNS on the device: done, one real bug found (`spikes/s5-*.log`)
- Base on this device: old Travo's AdGuard forwarding, `list server '127.0.0.1#5353'`, `noresolv=1`.
- **Bug**: `uci show` prints a one-element list exactly like an option. The stack restored it as `option server`, and dnsmasq's init script ignores `option server` (`config_list_foreach`). Result: no `server=` line, `noresolv` set, so every query was REFUSED. The config looked identical in `uci show`. Fixed: the CLI adapter reads with `uci export`, which keeps `list` vs `option`. A device-fixture regression test was added.
- After the fix: the captive layer over AdGuard resolves through the hotel/uplink resolver, and the pop restores base byte for byte with DNS working.
- `reload_config` reloads dnsmasq asynchronously (procd trigger): the new `server=` was live about 2 to 4 s after commit.
- AdGuard stopped: all LAN DNS REFUSED (confirms device-facts §11). Pushing a layer that points at the uplink resolver brought DNS back within 0.13 s (fail-open path works).

## S1 AdGuard package: done (`adguard/`)
- Package `adguardhome` 0.107.79-r1 (0.107.80-r1 available). Runs in `ujail` as user `adguardhome`.
- Config `/etc/adguardhome/adguardhome.yaml` (UCI `adguardhome.config.config_file`), work dir `/var/lib/adguardhome`. Both the yaml and `/etc/config/adguardhome` are apk conffiles and in `/lib/upgrade/keep.d/` (sysupgrade keeps them).
- As old Travo left it: `http.address: 0.0.0.0:3000`, `users: []`, DNS `bind_hosts: 0.0.0.0` port 5353. **The admin API is open to the whole LAN without auth** (GET and POST `/control/*` return 200). This is the risk from the baseline and still live on this device.
- `/control/install/get_addresses` returns 404 once configured, and `/install.html` still serves the wizard page.

## S2 AdGuard behind a proxy: done
A plain Go `httputil.ReverseProxy` on its own port (root path, no rewriting) served the UI, JS bundle and `/control/*` (GET and POST) against `users: []`. Issue AGH#7985 (`/control/profile` 401 without users) did not show up on 0.107.79. Conclusion: ADR 0006 works. Bind AGH to `127.0.0.1:3000`, and a Travo-gated port proxies it.

## New device facts
- BusyBox on the device has no `timeout`, `diff` or `pkill`.
- `wpad` provides hostapd and wpa_supplicant; `ubus -v list` shows `hostapd.<if>` with `get_clients`, `del_client`, `reload`.
- procd triggers: a `wireless` change reloads `network`, and a `dhcp` change reloads `dnsmasq` and `odhcpd`.
